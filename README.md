👨‍💻 Codes projects using Python & any language to create solutions to problems

I have a passion in the development of back-end and front-end systems using various technologies such as React, Python, Java, C++, C, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Dart, and Lua.

I create and manage game systems on the Roblox platform in my free time. I also like to contribute to the open source world.
